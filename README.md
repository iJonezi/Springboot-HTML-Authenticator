# Springboot-HTML-Authenticator

A project pulled from @practical-tutorials "Project Based Learning" repository.

This project was a walkthrough on how Springboot can be used to create secured HTML websites through user credentials stored in a Java configuration file.

This project created many questions in regards to the capabilities of Springboot and how it may be effectively tied into pulling authenticating information from a database. I plan to further experiement with Springboot, moving forward!
